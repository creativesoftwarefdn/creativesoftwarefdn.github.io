# Concept in a Nutshell

Weaviate is a web of things platform based on web semantics. This means that you can create relations between things but also gather information on a large scale from devices.

### Web of Things

In traditional IoT, _things_ are a synonym for a _connected device_. In Weaviate, things can be a device but also things which describe something from the physical world without it being connected.

Consider this example:

It is a web of things; some things are connected (the sensors and the ships) others aren't (like Alice and Bob). In the traditional Internet of Things we often only focus on the sensors and the ships, but actually, there are many more relations instead of only the sensors.

### Decentralized Platform

Weaviate is decentralized, when you make a reference from one node to another you can do this cross-platform. Because Weaviate is decentralized, you can make relations between different platforms.

### Time &amp; Graph

What Weaviate also allows you to do is to query to the graph based on time.
