# Examples

To get familiar with Weaviate, you can try it out using an example dataset. Semantic schemas describing a simple ontology of Things and Actions of a zoo can be found [here](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate-demo-zoo). 

## Setting up the demo dataset

When you [set up Weaviate](/weaviate/setting-up-weaviate/), make sure the location of the prepared [semantic schemas](https://github.com/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate-demo-zoo) is defined in the configuration file. When the Weaviate instance is up and running, you can start connecting data (Things and Actions). The sample set of Things and Actions in the zoo can be found [here](#). You can use this dataset to play around with the [Weaviate API](/weaviate/using-weaviate/use-the-weaviate-restful-api), or you can start with [this Python script](#), which imports all data at once. This Python script uses the package [weaviate_pyclient](https://github.com/laura-ham/weaviate_pyclient) to connect with the API of Weaviate.

Once you set up the demo dataset, start exploring the functionalities of Weaviate by connecting more data and using the RESTful API endpoints and the GraphQL endpoint.
