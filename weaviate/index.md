# Weaviate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/creativesoftwarefdn/weaviate/branches)

Weaviate is a decentralized, Semantic Graphql, RESTful Web of Things platform. With Weaviate you can create a graph of things. Regardless if it is a smart building 🏢, a crash of elephants 🐘 or a fleet of spaceships 🚀. With Weaviate you can create a time-based Web of Things Graph, and you can make relations cross-platform (i.e., relate an elephant to a spacecraft 😄👍).
